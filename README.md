# LearningProjects
This is a number of different small projects and algorithms , I am creating these as personal challenges in order to better understand coding principals and gain experience using them. I am going to implement most of these using c++ , however if I find that one algorythm is more suitable in perhaps a web application I might use a relevent language (i.e Javascript or Python)
